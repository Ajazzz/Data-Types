# A tuple is an ordered collection of items that cannot be modified once created.
# A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable, meaning you cannot change its contents once it has been created.

# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# Accessing items in a tuple
print(my_tuple[0])  # prints 1

# Iterating over a tuple
for item in my_tuple:
    print(item)
    
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
print(numbers[0]) # Output: 1
