# Data-Types
In computer programming, data types refer to the classification of different types of data that a programming language can work with. Each data type defines a set of values that can be stored and the operations that can be performed on them. Understanding data types is crucial in programming as it allows developers to write efficient and bug-free code.

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to some of the most common data types used in programming languages, including:

- Numeric Data Types,
- Boolean Data Type, 
- Character Data Type, \
- String Data Type, 

Each data type is described in detail, including its purpose, common use cases, and examples of code demonstrating how to work with the data type.
