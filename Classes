# In Python, classes are a way of defining user-defined data types. 
A class is like a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class.

Classes in Python encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data, providing a way to organize and reuse code. 
They can be used to model real-world objects, such as a car or a person, or to represent abstract concepts, such as a queue or a stack.

Here is an example of a simple class in Python:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def say_hello(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
