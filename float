# In Python, a float is a data type that represents decimal numbers. 
It is a numeric type, just like integers, but with the ability to represent fractional values.
Here's an example of defining a float variable in Python:

my_float = 3.14
print(my_float)
Output: 3.14

# You can perform arithmetic operations on floats just like you can with integers, 
including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here are some examples:

x = 3.0
y = 2.0

print(x + y) # 5.0
print(x - y) # 1.0
print(x * y) # 6.0
print(x / y) # 1.5

# One thing to keep in mind when working with floats is that they are not always exact. 
This is because the computer represents floats in binary, and not all decimal numbers can be represented exactly in binary. 
As a result, you may encounter small rounding errors in calculations involving floats. For example:

print(0.1 + 0.2) # 0.30000000000000004
