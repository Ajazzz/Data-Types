In Python, there are several built-in data types that can be used to store different kinds of values. Here are some of the most commonly used data types in Python:

Integer: An integer is a whole number without a decimal point. For example:

a = 10
b = -5


Float: A float is a number with a decimal point. For example:

c = 3.14
d = -2.5

String: A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. For example:

e = "Hello, World!"
f = 'Python is awesome!'

Boolean: A Boolean is a data type that has only two possible values: True or False. For example:

g = True
h = False

List: A list is a collection of items separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets. For example:

i = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
j = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

Tuple: A tuple is similar to a list, but its items are enclosed in parentheses instead of square brackets and cannot be modified once created. For example:

k = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
l = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

Dictionary: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs separated by colons and enclosed in curly braces. For example:

m = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
n = {'fruit1': 'apple', 'fruit2': 'banana', 'fruit3': 'cherry'}

These are just some examples of the data types available in Python.
There are also more specialized data types and libraries that can be used for more complex programming tasks.
