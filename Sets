# A set is an unordered collection of unique items.
# You can perform set operations such as union, intersection, and difference on sets.



# Creating a set
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# Adding an item to a set
fruits.add("orange")

# Removing an item from a set
fruits.remove("banana")

# Iterating over a set
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    
colors = {'red', 'green', 'blue'}
colors.add('yellow')
print(colors) # Output: {'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'}
